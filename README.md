# ANZ-Virtual_Internship
Data@ANZ is about mining and linking datasets to develop stories that matter and challenge the status quo, to deliver on ANZ’s purpose “to shape a world where people and communities thrive”.
Our data people love to explore opportunities, innovate, be challenged and transform their ideas, and have created this experience to give you a taste of some of the challenging problems they love to tackle.

If you are thinking about a data career, and want to see what it looks like, then the Data@ANZ Virtual Internship is the program for you!

By providing your contact details and indicating interest/agreeing to contact through the participation in this virtual internship, ANZ will include you in our Data@ANZ extended community, where we share opportunities to connect and participate in open hackathons, skill seminars and more.
